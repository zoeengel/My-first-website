    <p align= "center"; style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">I really enjoy listening to the different genres of psytrance, some of the sub genres that fall under psytrance include dark prog, forest and goa trance. This music genres has little to no lyrics but it's
        the melodies that really speak to you, to your soul.

    <h2 align= "center"><mark><font face= "Dyuthi">MUSIC FESTIVALS</font></mark></h2>
    <p align= "center"; style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Just like with other music genres, theres be concerts where the artist perform and play their music live, in this case we call it a fesitval instead of a 
        concert, where there'll be a line-up comprising of multiple Dj's, each with atleast a two hour set. This is where we all cone together to connect with 
        the music and each other. A temporary escape of life.
